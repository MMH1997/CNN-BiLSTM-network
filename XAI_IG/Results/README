# Explainability Results

This folder contains the attribution outputs produced by Integrated Gradients for the CNN–BiLSTM model.

Results are organized by dataset and prediction horizon, following the same experimental setup as the original model.

## Input Variables

Each input sample consists of 9 variables evaluated at 4 historical time steps (t, t−1, t−2, t−3), resulting in 36 features per sample.

The variables are:

1. Target street traffic flow  
2. Auxiliary street 1 traffic flow  
3. Auxiliary street 2 traffic flow  
4. Mean temperature  
5. Minimum temperature  
6. Maximum temperature  
7. Rainfall  
8. Day type (working day / weekend / holiday)  
9. Hour of day  

All variables are normalized using min–max scaling.

## Output Format

Results are stored as aggregated CSV files, one per dataset.

Each CSV contains the average absolute Integrated Gradients attribution values organized as:

- Rows: input variables  
- Columns: historical time steps (`t`, `t-1`, `t-2`, `t-3`)  
- Final column: mean attribution across all time steps  


Each row corresponds to one input variable, and values represent the averaged absolute attribution over all analysed test samples.

## Organization

Results are grouped by dataset and horizon, with one CSV file per configuration, for example:

- `XAI_AS12.csv`
- `XAI_AS24.csv`
- `XAI_CA72.csv`


File names encode the street and prediction horizon.

These CSV files are directly used to generate the plots included in the `figures/` folder.

## Notes

- Values correspond to averaged absolute attributions.
- Each CSV is normalized independently.
- Comparisons between datasets should be interpreted in relative terms only.
